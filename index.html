    <body> Hello, English 388 
        <p>The name's in the title and I'd like to consider myself a generally interesting person. I'm taking Professional Technical Writing in my last quarter here at UW as the last technical writing class went totally over my head and I'd like to try this thing again. I'm really looking forward to working with everyone as we bring unique skillsets and backgrounds to the classroom.  </p>
