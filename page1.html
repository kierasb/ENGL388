    <body> Hello, English 388 
        <p>The name's in the title and I'd like to consider myself a generally interesting person. I'm taking Professional Technical Writing in my last quarter here at UW as the last technical writing class went totally over my head and I'd like to try this thing again. I'm really looking forward to working with everyone as we bring unique skillsets and backgrounds to the classroom.  </p>
    <h1>Favorite Foods</h1>
<p>I typically prefer Japanese homecooking with my favorite foods being a traditional Okinawan dish. Most of my favorite foods can be served with rice, and while I consider it a favorite food, I won't list it since it's a regular staple. </p>
<h1>Favorite Bands</h1>
<p>I listen to many different types of music so it's hard to pick a favorite but I probably listen to Bossa Nova and progressive metal the most. My favorite Bossa Nova artist is Bebel Gilberto. I listen to a lot of single artists, but I'll provide some band names for the list. The list definitely changes a lot.</p>
